# curriculum_comparison

A comparison of front-end curricula (where batches are selected according to some metric that ranks data in the feature space) versus automated curricula (where metrics that are obtained during learning such as loss are used in order to sample the next batch). 

These are used on algorithms that are trained using stochastic gradient descent, in this case, neural networks.
